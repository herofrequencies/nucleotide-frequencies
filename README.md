DNA / Nucleotide Frequency Catalog built from NIH nucleotide data using the Charlene Boehm (DNA) algorithm.

The calculations here are based upon the 2002 patent by Charlene Boehm, and are an extension of the frequency list found at dnafrequencies.com.

Calculations are also available according to the Spooky2 algorithm, published in 2020, shortly after the expiration of the Boehm patent.  They are contained in spreadsheets listed in the "NIH Strain Detail" for comparison purposes.

Use these frequencies at your own risk and responsibly.

This list is not intended to diagnose, treat or cure any disease.
